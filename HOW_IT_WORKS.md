# 🎯 How the Lead Generation System Works

## ✅ Updated: No Fake Data Generation

The system now **only uses real data from AI** and never generates fake websites or contact information.

---

## 🔄 Two Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Demo Mode (Default)
**Purpose:** Quick demonstrations and testing without API calls

**What it uses:**
- ✅ Pre-populated real company data (Avery Dennison, 3M, etc.)
- ✅ Real websites from known companies
- ✅ Proper revenue and employee counts
- ✅ AI-generated outreach messages (if API available)
- ✅ Mock contact info for demonstration purposes

**When to use:**
- Quick demos
- Testing the interface
- When rate limited

### Mode 2: Real AI Data (100% Real)

```
Prompt: "List major trade shows for Graphics & Signage industry"
AI Returns: Real event names and descriptions
```

#### Step 2: AI Identifies Companies
