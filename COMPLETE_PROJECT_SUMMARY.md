Subject: Enhancing Avery Dennison's Graphics Solutions

Hi Sarah,

I came across Avery Dennison's impressive leadership in graphics 
solutions—especially your work in high-performance materials for 
signage and branding. With your focus on innovation, I thought 
you'd appreciate how DuPont® Tedlar® films could further elevate 
your offerings.

Our protective films are engineered for extreme durability, weather 
resistance, and UV protection—key for outdoor graphics that need 
to stay vibrant and intact.

Would you be open to a quick chat next week to explore how Tedlar® 
could complement your product development goals?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Congrats on Avery Dennison's continued growth—$8.5B revenue 
is no small feat!
```

### ✅ Test 4: Demo Workflow
