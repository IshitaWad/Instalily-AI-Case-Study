# üîß Streamlit Widget Key Fix

## Problem
The outreach message was showing the same content (always 3M) for all companies when clicking through the list.

## Root Cause
**Streamlit Widget Caching Issue**

In Streamlit, every widget needs a unique `key`. If multiple widgets share the same key, Streamlit caches the first value and shows it for all instances.

### The Bug:
```python
st.text_area(
    "Copy this message for your outreach:",
    lead['outreach_message'],
    height=250,
    key=f"outreach_detail",  # ‚ùå SAME KEY FOR ALL COMPANIES
    label_visibility="collapsed"
)
```

When you clicked different companies, Streamlit kept showing the cached text area from the first company (3M) because the key never changed.

## The Fix

### Before:
```python
key=f"outreach_detail"  # Static key - always the same
```

### After:
```python
key=f"outreach_detail_{st.session_state.selected_lead_index}"  # Dynamic key - changes with selection
```

Now each company gets its own unique key:
- Company 0: `outreach_detail_0`
- Company 1: `outreach_detail_1`
- Company 2: `outreach_detail_2`

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:
1. **Click "Avery Dennison"** (index 0)
   - Key: `outreach_detail_0`
   - Shows: Avery Dennison's message

2. **Click "3M"** (index 1)
   - Key: `outreach_detail_1`
   - Shows: 3M's message

3. **Click "Arlon Graphics"** (index 2)
   - Key: `outreach_detail_2`
   - Shows: Arlon's message

Each company now displays its own unique outreach message!

## Why This Matters

### Streamlit Widget Keys:
- Streamlit uses keys to track widget state
- Same key = same cached value
- Different keys = different values
- Keys must be unique across the entire app

### Common Pitfall:
```python
# ‚ùå BAD - Same key in a loop
for i, item in enumerate(items):
    st.button("Click", key="my_button")  # All buttons have same key!

# ‚úÖ GOOD - Unique key for each
for i, item in enumerate(items):
    st.button("Click", key=f"my_button_{i}")  # Each button has unique key
```

## Testing

### Test Steps:
1. Run the app: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
2. Generate leads (demo mode)
3. Click first company - note the outreach message
4. Click second company - message should be DIFFERENT
5. Click third company - message should be DIFFERENT again
6. Click back to first company - original message should appear

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ Each company shows its own unique outreach message
‚úÖ Messages change when you click different companies
‚úÖ No caching issues

## ‚úÖ Fixed!

The outreach messages will now correctly display for each company when you click through the list.

**Test it now:**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Click through the companies and verify each shows its own unique message! üéâ
