Subject: Enhancing Durability & Visual Appeal for Avery Dennison's Graphics Solutions

Hi Sarah,

I came across Avery Dennison's impressive leadership in graphics solutions—especially 
your work in high-performance materials for signage and branding. With your focus on 
innovation, I thought you'd appreciate how DuPont® Tedlar® films could further elevate 
your offerings.

Our protective films are engineered for extreme durability, weather resistance, and UV 
protection—key for outdoor graphics that need to stay vibrant and intact. They also 
enhance visual appeal, ensuring your clients' branding stands out longer.

Would you be open to a quick chat next week to explore how Tedlar® could complement 
your product development goals? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Congrats on Avery Dennison's continued growth—$8.5B revenue is no small feat!
```
